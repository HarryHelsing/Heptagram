# Heptagram

Tool for divination based upon the I Ching
Terminal based Heptagram generator (akin to the I Ching's ***hexagram*** but with seven lines)

***

### To-do
- Create a list of names for the heptagrams that show up when generated
- Create mechanism for "changing lines" (reference changing lines in I Ching)

***

### Research
- Historical *hexagram* orders, binary, King Wen Sequence ect
- Chakras reflective of a line within each heptagram 7,6,5,4,3,2,1
    1: Root 2: Sacral 3: Solar Plexus 4: Heart 5: Throat 6: Third Eye 7: Crown
    With Root on the bottom and Crown on top
- Probabilities in changing lines for coding changing lines
    (look into coins I Ching method and sticks method for probability.)
